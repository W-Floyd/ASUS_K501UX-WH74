A simple script to automatically configure your system to fix any compatability issues I found. Use at your own risk. Tested on Ubuntu 16.04

Note: As of 2017-04-05, I am not using Ubuntu anymore (I changed months ago, actually). Though the mentioned script should still hold true, the following is probably more useful, and has changed a bit:

Use the boot options 'acpi\_osi=!' and 'acpi\_backlight=native' to make shortcut keys work and allow a wide range of backlight level.
